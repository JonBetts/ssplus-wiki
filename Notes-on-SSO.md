In the ssplus codebase, we have a file called _samlKeystore.jks_ that holds the certificate/public-private key pair we use for SSL handshaking and validation of SAML signatures. The Spring SAML module uses this automatically when SSO requests are made in the app by a user. Each of our clients that use our SSO functionality, sent us their public key during setup. Annoyingly, these have to be added to the Java runtime keystore in order to work properly, which can be found on servers at _$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts_. Depending on the format that the public key is in, you will need to find a way to do this import manually. [This](https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-java-keytool-keystore-commands.html) url gives a good list of commands that you can run to manipulate keystore files, etc. [This](https://cinhtau.net/2016/03/11/copy-contents-of-java-keystore-to-another-keystore/) link has a command that will copy from one keystore to another. Add _-srcalias_ and _-destalias_ arguments in order to only export one key at a time. I won't give specific commands because they'll probably change slightly over time, but the main thing to remember is that the client's public key needs to be added to the Java runtime keystore somehow when setting up a new site for a client with this functionality. Java 8 servers may or may not require more changes. We'll see in the near future!
